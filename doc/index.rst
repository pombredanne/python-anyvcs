python-anyvcs |version| (|release|)
===================================

python-anyvcs is an abstraction layer for the homogenous, local handling of:

* Bare and non-bare Git repositories
* Mercurial repositories
* Subversion repositories (what ``svnadmin create`` makes)

Getting Started
---------------

Here's a simple example for an existing repository:

    >>> import anyvcs
    >>> repo = anyvcs.open('/path/to/repo')

``repo`` is an instance of :class:`anyvcs.common.VCSRepo` with a variety of
operations available for it.
